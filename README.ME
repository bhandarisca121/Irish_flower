## Overview
This project implements a **machine learning model** to classify Iris flowers into their species based on sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is one of the most popular datasets for beginners in machine learning and classification tasks.

The dataset contains 150 samples of three species of Iris flowers:
- **Iris setosa**
- **Iris versicolor**
- **Iris virginica**

Each sample has four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
